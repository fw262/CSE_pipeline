This pipeline takes in bam files from bulk RNA-seq data generated by the nf-core and generates a Chromatin State Expression matrix. The annotations are based on the full stack ChromHMM annotations from [here](https://github.com/ernstlab/full_stack_ChromHMM_annotations/tree/main).

### Instructions
1) Please ensure the following tools are installed.
[snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)



3) Move or link all the nf-core bam output files into a folder called "data".
4) List sample names (no ".bam" suffix) in the "sampleNames.txt" file with 1 sample per line.
